This directory contains routine for generating ice drift from
a) A series daily files in HYCOM_CICE with name format: iceh.????-??-??.nc
b) Also to support the ensemble files like the names as iceh.????-??-??_???.nc
c) A daily ice drift from OSISAF: https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/osi-455 (if extending to 2 days then to modify the parameter:NDAYS_OSISAF_DRIFT)
d) There are two basic outputs: Mod_drift000.nc and Obs_drift.txt, the latter citing the used observation file


icedriftnc_osisaf: When called with no arguments it shows how to add the arguments.  It contains two ways to run:
        Case 1: (validation one model run)
        icedriftnc_osisaf iceh.2019-01-01.nc /cluster/projects/nn2993k/TP4b0.12/idrft_osisaf/
        It automatically searches the observation from the predefined directory, and requires more one day drift from the previous date at the current diretory.            

        Case 2: (validation ensemble model runs)
        icedriftnc_osisaf iceh.2019-01-01.nc /cluster/projects/nn2993k/TP4b0.12/idrft_osisaf/ 100
        It also requires the relevant model files avaiable at the current direcdtory using the name format as the b) mentioned.

valid_icedrift.sh: Wrapper around icedriftnc_osisaf to calcuulate icedrift for one a snapshot from a model run. And use a python routine of Firstview_icespeed.py ploting the all drift fields and their scatter plots.

NB: Drift is calculated using a Runge-kutta 2nd order approach
